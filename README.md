# SwahBERT: Language model of Swahili
Is a pretrained monolingual language model for Swahili. <br>
The model was trained for 800K steps using a corpus of 105MB that was collected from news sites, online discussion, and Wikipedia. <br>
The evaluation was perfomed on several downstream tasks such as emotion classification, news classification, sentiment classification, and Named entity recognition.

```ruby
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("swahbert-base-uncased")

# Tokenized input
text = "Mlima Kilimanjaro unapatikana Tanzania"
tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

SwahBERT => ['mlima', 'kilimanjaro', 'unapatikana', 'tanzania']
mBERT => ['ml', '##ima', 'ki', '##lima', '##nja', '##ro', 'una', '##patikana', 'tan', '##zania']

```

## Pre-training data
The text was extracted from different sorces;<br>
 - News sites: `United Nations news, Voice of America (VoA), Deutsche Welle (DW) and taifaleo`<br>
 - Forums: `JaiiForum`<br>
 - ``Wikipedia``.

## Emotion Dataset
We released the Swahili emotion dataset.
The data consists of ~13K emotion annotated comments from social media platforms and translated English dataset. 
The data is multi-label with six Ekmanâ€™s emotions:  happy, surprise, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust or neutral.

## Evaluation
The model was tested on four downstream tasks including our new emotion dataset
